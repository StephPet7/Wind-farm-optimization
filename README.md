# Wind-farm-optimization
Design the control algorithm of a wind turbine. The wind turbine is located in a environnement in which the wind is hard to predict. The goal is to decide in real time of the angle of the turbine in order to maximize the energy production while minimizing rotation costs using Markov Decisions Process and Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
